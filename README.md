Code and answers were added to complete the projects.


**Descriptions and links to the project notebooks**

### Dog Breed Classifier

Build an algorithm to detect whether an image contains a dog or human faces, and classify the breed of dog, or closest resembling breed for a human. Use transfer learning with pre-trained features from a popular network to obtain a more accurate model. The project concludes with classifying some images of dogs and humans, with interesting results.

### Time series prediction and text generation with RNN

Build an algorithm to predict stock prices from a time series. Build an algorithm to generate text one character at a time using the text of Sherlock Holmes. [Link to project notebook](https://github.com/dbolotov/udacity-aind2/blob/master/dog-project/dog_app.ipynb).
