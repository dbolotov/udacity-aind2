#### Descriptions and links to the project notebooks

#### [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/dbolotov/udacity-aind2/blob/master/dog-project/dog_app.ipynb)

- Build an algorithm to detect whether an image contains a dog or human faces, and classify the breed of dog, or closest resembling breed for a human
- Use transfer learning with pre-trained features from a popular network to obtain a more accurate model
- The project concludes with classifying some images of dogs and humans, with interesting results.

#### [Time series prediction and text generation with RNN](https://github.com/dbolotov/udacity-aind2/blob/master/text-generation-rnn/RNN_project.ipynb)

- Build an algorithm to predict stock prices from a time series
- Build an algorithm to generate text one character at a time using the text of Sherlock Holmes. The resulting text is mostly real english words!
